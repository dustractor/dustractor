Blender Addons:

* [propchart](https://github.com/dustractor/propchart)  
  Similar in concept to 'Property Chart' -- an addon which has always come
  bundled with Blender -- They both allow you to expose arbitrary properties on
  the sidebard UI, but this one lets you access more properties than dotted
  notation will allow (Namely access of items inside of collections).
* [matlib](https://github.com/dustractor/matlib)  
  A material librarian for blender.  Just shows up as three dots on your
  material properties panel, a menu providing A) to add or choose the library
  folder, B) a menu of all the materials found in the library, and C) an
  operation to send the current material to the library. Does not require
  saving the blend file. The scanning for materials is done at blender startup
  and kept in an sqlite database. Speedy operation, no thumbnails or
  thumbnailer, use good names for your materials and you're good to go!
* [tkit](https://github.com/dustractor/tkit)  
  This one is just a handful of super-handy edge-selection operators such as:
  extend at the tips, deselect the tips, select edges touching the tips, select
  the outer border, deselect the outer border, select parallel or not parallel. 

Vim Plugins:

* [ritmus](https://github.com/dustractor/ritmus)  
  My Vim-as-an-IDE flow needs one of these. It's so I can press a button and
  run some code, in another terminal, with the least amount of hassle.  Ok,
  some hassle because currently it only does 'smart' stuff for python but if a
  Makefile is present then it uses that, so you're able to run whatever.
* [argloco](https://github.com/dustractor/argloco)  My Vim-as-an-IDE flow also
  needed one of these.  I put a command in a file and source it. The command
  sets up my editor with named taboo tabs and local argument lists so there can
  be semantic grouping and a way to cycle within groups (:GoForth & :GoBackth)
  as well as among groups (gt & gT).
* [dazi](https://github.com/dustractor/dazi)  
  Edit a graphviz dot file, press a button to see it rendered in feh. Press
  escape to close feh. In feh right-click -> save image puts the file in home.
